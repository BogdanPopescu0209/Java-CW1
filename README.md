# Java-CW1

 Task1 - cipher based on the encryption of the positions of vowels and
consonants from the English alphabet.

Task2 - presents a simple word-based version of a classic memory game which would normally involve cards with pictures
that are laid out with all the cards
face down. The idea is (on each player turn) to select two cards (one after the other) and reveal the pictures.
If the pictures match the player has made a pair and would score a point. If the pictures do not match, then
both cards are turned back over so that the picture is hidden, and nothing is scored. Over the duration of the
game, the skill is to try to remember the positions of the cards and create matched pairs.

Task3 -  simulation of this simple wrist device.
